tagline: I bring life to code
occupation: Front End Developer | UI/UX Designer
summary: >-
  A visual person who can convert data to a graphical interface. The look, the
  feel and the design of a site is the object of my existence. A lover or a
  friend of a browser; a protagonist in a web story; antagonist of bugs.

  <br><br>

  Behind my belt, I started as email developer, then web designer and wed developer; a UI/UX Designer certified. 

  <br><br>

  Perseverance is of paramount importance. Excellence is sacrosanct. Never cease from learning; reserved, yet collaborator. Do not always go for conventional; na√Øve yet, adventurous.
note: Ralph is currently not entertaining any projects as of the moment this season.
