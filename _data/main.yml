tagline: I bring life to code
occupation: Front End Developer | UI/UX Designer
summary: A visual person who can convert data to a graphical interface. The
  look, the feel and the design of a site is the object of my existence. A lover
  or a friend of a browser; a protagonist in a web story; antagonist of bugs.
  <br><br> Behind my belt, I started as email developer, then web designer and
  web developer; a UI/UX Designer certified.  <br><br> Perseverance is of
  paramount importance. Excellence is sacrosanct. Never cease from learning;
  reserved, yet collaborator. Do not always go for conventional; na√Øve yet,
  adventurous.
