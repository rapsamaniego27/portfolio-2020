        I don't usually watch Korean Drama but my ex-girlfriend got me to watch
        it and somehow I enjoyed it. The show was called "Business Proposal". 

        It's about this Grandfather who wants his grandson to be married to any woman on the list he made and that grandson ended up falling in love with an impostor who took her bestfriend's place just so her bestfriend can avoid him and she can tell the guy that she doesn't want him.

        <br><br>

        This show was really funny, and noticed that there actually a lot of classical pieces used as background music. Though the scenes might be a bit cheesy, but what I like about the show is it's straightforwardness and about confessing love for each other or just trying to resolve a problem. 

        <br><br>

        The characters are driven by a situation they don't want to be in. Sometimes they tend to get vengeful, upset, quiet or even angry but after all theyre all human beings right? But I like how they are so straightforward that they want to solve something on how real humans are supposed to do.

        <br><br>

        In my experience, I find some too passive and would always resolve to ghosting or giving up. I recommend this show as it gives an example of not giving up on the people you care for and life is too short to hold back what you feel.
