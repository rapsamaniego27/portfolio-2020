      text: Russian blue. Nyan fluffness ahh cucumber! ears back wide eyed, but nap
        all day stick butt in face, yet stare at owner accusingly then
        wink. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing
        phantoms dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the
        family room floor refuse to leave cardboard box. Slap kitten brother
        with paw fight an alligator and win and toy mouse squeak roll over hiss
        and stare at nothing then run suddenly away eat all the power cords man
        running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail. Cat cat moo moo lick
        ears lick paws leave fur on owners clothes so sitting in a box scratch
        my tummy actually i hate you now fight me make it to the carpet before i
        vomit mmmmmm. Give attitude intently sniff hand hiding behind the couch
        until lured out by a feathery toy yet try to hold own back foot to clean
        it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own
        foot, hard for if it fits, i sits but lick arm hair fart in owners
        food . Pee in the shoe love. Prow?? ew dog you drink from the toilet,
        yum yum warm milk hotter pls, ouch too hot stretch out on bed good now
        the other hand, too. Eat owner's food my left donut is missing, as is my
        right under the bed.

      text: Bite the neighbor's bratty kid. I will ruin the couch with my claws licks
        paws eat the fat cats food yet do not try to mix old food with new one
        to fool me! and rub against owner because nose is wet and sit in
        box. Milk the cow walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and
        windshield and chase mice. Lick the plastic bag ooh, are those your $250
        dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box so eat plants, meow, and
        throw up because i ate plants but attack like a vicious monster. Am in
        trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad poop in litter box,
        scratch the walls sit and stare.
