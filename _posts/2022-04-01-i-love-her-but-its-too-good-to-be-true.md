        I longed for love and probably longed for it more since the day I broke
        up with my ex from last August of 2018. For the first 18 months, I knew
        I can conquer myself alone. I was at my phase where I'm really
        establishing myself in my professional career, music, financial status,
        travel goals and all the adult plans that adults are gearing up for. 

        <br></br>

        So I tried online dating. Long story short, I've been on and off with this app and dated so many girls just trying to look for the perfect match. 

        After the family issue that happened in my house, my friend Gillan was so concerned I went on a Zambales breather.

        Once I got back. I went online dating again and found this beautiful
        woman on OKC. We didn't match unfortunately but I managed to reach out
        to her because her instagram account was in her biography. 

        I viewed her like any other girl on dating apps just seeking for that Knight in Shining Armor until I found out she's really strong and was even more like a Knight than I am. But I never gave up and tried my luck to ask her out and wanted to show her how much of a Warrior I am.

        As time went by, after all those stories about her 4 exes, I realized
        that she was scary. She is so straight with her decisions she's not
        noticing sometimes that she treats relationships like empty bottles.
        Meaning she'll date you since you are still full of things in that
        bottle, but once she finishes all of whats inside she'd throw it away.  

        <br><br>

        Some of her exes are quite bad, but there are some who were actually quite ok. And I didn't really want to be part of a collection. I dated online just for the sake of finding a companion even just as a friend. Society and my situation has turned me very anxious about my future and I'm financially unstable. That's why I couldn't really commit since girls are more practical today.

        out. I loved her, cared for her. She appreciated it until the mistakes
        happened when we started living together for 2 months from January to
        February of 2022.
