        I longed for love and probably longed for it more since the day I broke
        up with my ex from last August of 2018. For the first 18 months, I knew
        I can conquer myself alone. I was at my phase where I'm really
        establishing myself in my professional career, music, financial status,
        travel goals and all the adult plans that adults are gearing up for. 

        <br></br>

        So I tried online dating. Long story short, I've been on and off with this app and dated so many girls just trying to look for the perfect match. 

        After the family issue that happened in my house, my friend Gillan was so concerned I went on a Zambales breather.

        Once I got back. I went online dating again and found this beautiful
        woman on OKC. We didn't match unfortunately but I managed to reach out
        to her because her instagram account was in her biography. 

        I viewed her like any other girl on dating apps just seeking for that Knight in Shining Armor until I found out she's really strong and was even more like a Knight than I am. But I never gave up and tried my luck to ask her out and wanted to show her how much of a Warrior I am.

        She was really sweet, she isn't just sweet sweet! It was like Candy
        Sweet. She was also kind, caring and strong. She also tells you a lot of
        good stories. She loves travelling and coffee very much. She even earns
        double or probably triple the salary I was earnin and she lives alone.
        Which really made me anxious. 

        <br><br>

        Just like what I would usually do when I date someone, Once I feel a deeper feeling or I feel like I might not be able to take care of them, I tell them my life story and how I'm internally struggling on the identity I want to be.. The following includes: Me still living with my parents, no car, loves music which means less time for anything else, not much savings, tough family relationship and I am a mediocre programmer.

        <br><br>

        I tell people these for them to have enough time to leave me already and find someone else. But this girl never gave up and still sticked around. She loved me for who I am, and was even willing to let me live and grow with her, so that I can be away from my parents. I was really careful not to fall in love because when I do, I don't just give up on them and girls might be annoyed for the fact that I still hang on. 

        <br><br>

        So yeah, as much as it hurts to get ghosted from the start of the date, it's easier to move on that way. 

        Everything was too good to be true because no girl likes a guy like me but my talent. And I don't like being appreciated for just my talent, and all of deserve to be appreciated also for our life stories and struggles.

        <br><br>

        As time went by, she was driving me nuts. I really liked her and my love language is affirmation. She confirms that she wants having me around and really considering to date me. But I felt like it wasn't enough.

        <br><br>
         Anyway, she told me stories about her 4 exes, I realized that she was scary. She is so straight with her decisions she's not noticing sometimes that she treats relationships like empty bottles. Meaning she'll date you since you are still full of things in that bottle, but once she finishes all of whats inside she'd throw it away.  Which got me holding back a bit.
        <br><br>

        Some of her exes are quite bad, but there are some who were actually quite ok. And I didn't really want to be part of a collection. I dated online just for the sake of finding a companion even just as a friend. Society and my situation has turned me very anxious about my future and I'm financially unstable. That's why I couldn't really commit since girls are more practical today.

        But in the end. Love still prevailed. She showed me that money isn't an
        obstacle, she cared for what I go through sincerely so we decided to try
        it out. I loved her, cared for her, cooked food, played music and
        cuddled with her. She appreciated everything until our mistakes happened
        when we started living together for 2 months from January to February of
        2022.

        <br><br>

        She was already leaning towards the breakup route which I didn't like. We always fight for love if you know that there is a way to solve things... Everything was ok until she stopped fighting her love for me and her parents have become suspicious thinking that I would hurt her physically. 

        <br><br>

        But I told them that I don't resolve to violence. And so with all these things happening, my heart was squished to the point that I couldn't think things through. I was literally crying for hours everyday. 

        So I decided to move back to my parent's house since that's what she wanted anyway. She even offered me to live with her but the label as bf / gf was off.

        <br><br>

        It was so damn hurtful! I knew from the start, she'd hurt me. I could still feel my heart like it's still crying up to this day. I wasn't a perfect man, I made mistakes. But she never gave us a chance to fix it together.

        <br><br>

        I know what she said of not going back, but I loved this girl and I'd rather die trying  than not try at all. She means the entire world to me.
