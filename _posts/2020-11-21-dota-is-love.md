      text: "*Slivers of the Mad Moon cast their waning light across the land. A
        dormant beast stirs in his cave, a powerful hunger overcoming the arcane
        tendrils that bind him in his hibernation. We once celebrated his taste
        for sweets and the blood spilled in his honor by both Radiant and Dire.
        But that was quite long ago. Yet he stirs.*"
