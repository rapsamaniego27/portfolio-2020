        I went through some existential crisis. Just as I decided to fix my
        career and be someone I wanted to be, I knew I had to sacrifice my
        favorite game. I actually got to let go of DOTA and I didn't play for
        almost 2 years. 

        <br><br>

        But then my bestfriend Darwin invited me for a game after 2 years of not playing with them, since I was almost finished with my personal projects for my next career I played and I was even more addictive than ever. I even subscribed for a GamerzClass for a few months just to adjust to the meta.

        As I was playing, I realized that the game of DOTA has gone more
        complexed than the last time I played it. Every matches I played there's
        always a role to be assigned to be players and dedicated my life to the
        offlane role. 

        <br><br>

        The Offlaner is usually the one setting up fights, tanking for the team, looking for the good entry and protecting the Carry. But I think it's also the least played if Im not mistaken so learned the role.

        I enjoyed playing the game until the last week of February of 2022 where
        I realized that I might have been playing too much and not paying
        attention to my Relationship, Career and Music. So I decided to stop for
        the better. 

        <br><br>

        But the time I have stopped playing, it was too late for me to fix things that have been affected and there are things I couldn't get back anymore. I don't treat the game as a curse but sometimes too much of something is bad even for games. 

        <br><br>

        I had a heart to heart talk with my bestfriend Darwin and told him I don't want to play anymore, and I still need to continue to re-establish myself as its not over. I love the game but I may need to let go for awhile.
