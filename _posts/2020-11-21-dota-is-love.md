      text: "*Slivers of the Mad Moon cast their waning light across the land. A
        dormant beast stirs in his cave, a powerful hunger overcoming the arcane
        tendrils that bind him in his hibernation. We once celebrated his taste
        for sweets and the blood spilled in his honor by both Radiant and Dire.
        But that was quite long ago. Yet he stirs. Could it be? Yes! Now comes
        the season of Roshan! And with him comes an all-new Halloween game mode,
        rewards upon rewards, gobs of candy to steal and a heaping new treasure
        for one and all. Lo, it’s Diretide.*"

        Diretide is not the only thing that is back from the past this year: The
        Hallowed Chest of the Diretide, with more than 60 items among 5 tiers,
        including Immortals and Emblems, reintroduces the Chest and Key system.
        Similar to Dota chests from 2013 and CSGO, the Chest of the Diretide
        drops as a reward for playing and is opened with a key purchasable on
        the store. Both the Chest and its contents are immediately marketable
        and can be purchased and sold on the Marketplace directly from inside
        the client. Additionally, we are introducing a Trade Up system that
        allows you to turn 10 items of a tier into a random item of a tier
        higher. Don’t have 10 items of the same tier? We will help you
        automatically fill the empty slots with the cheapest items from the
        marketplace so you can find the best bargains and turn them into more
        valuable items. Like CSGO crates as well, the odds of tier 1 to tier 4
        are 1:5 compared to the tier immediately below. The odds for the
        cosmically rare emblems are 1:100000, like previous emblems.
